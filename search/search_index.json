We will walk through each step of connecting to and querying the device, configuring voltage/current setpoints, and performing controlled sweeps to characterize system behavior (e.g., voltage or current sweeps). By running live demonstrations of Python scripts, participants will observe how to capture real-time data\u2014such as measured voltages and currents\u2014and generate plots for analysis and reporting. We will also discuss important safety and equipment-protection measures, including setting appropriate voltage/current limits, managing output channels, and verifying signal integrity.
