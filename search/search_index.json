Meta-optics hold great potential to promote a new generation of ultra-compact optical systems. Inverse design strategies have been developed to either improve the optical performance or enable novel functions. In this talk, I will briefly overview the conventional forward design method based on meta-atom library search, and then present two different inverse design examples. Firstly, we demonstrated ultrathin 2D metasurfaces (thickness ~ 1/5 of the wavelength) with nonlocal interactions. We developed a global evolutionary optimization approach based on the genetic algorithm, which improves the resonant metalens focusing efficiency by more than 50%. The optimized designs were experimentally validated based on nanofabrication using electron beam lithography. Secondly, I will also introduce the inverse design of 3D metamaterials with novel multi-functions using the adjoint method. We develop 3D meta-optics to leverage the wealth of invisible wavefront information (e.g., polarization, spatial mode, etc), which are fabricated by two-photon polymerization (TPP) lithography.

They provide a unifying language for phenomena involving hybridized modes in diverse platforms, ranging from ultracold atomic gases to semiconductors in optical microcavities. For spectroscopists, this often translates into the routine task of fitting complex spectral features to extract quantitative information from their optical measurements, such as resonance positions, linewidths, and interaction strengths.</p> <p>In this talk, I present a special case encountered in my own research: a Feshbach resonance in a van der Waals heterostructure involving two excitonic modes \u2013 one optically bright, the other entirely dark. In particular, since the coupling strength is much smaller than the intrinsic excitonic linewidth, the interaction is effectively invisible in any single spectrum.

In this talk, I will present how I used Python to automate these processes for an experiment I built to measure changes in photoluminescence as a function of applied magnetic field. The Python script I developed controls three instruments simultaneously: a cryostat that sets and stabilizes both the magnetic field and temperature, a mechanical shutter that protects the sample from continuous excitation, and a lock-in amplifier that receives the collected signal. Between each magnetic field setpoint, the script automatically triggers measurements, adjusts experimental conditions, and updates two live plots for real-time visualization. This streamlines long experimental sessions, reduces sample degradation and manual errors, and provides insight into the evolving dataset. The tools and strategies I will share are broadly applicable to many photonics setups that require inter-instrument communication and live data monitoring.</p> <p>Bio: Sarah\u2019s research is at the intersection of nanoscience and photonics.

A thin film sample is placed on the stage, which moves precisely while simultaneously measuring the optical transmission through a photodiode positioned after the sample. The code will be written from scratch live, with opportunities for participants to modify parameters themselves, fostering an interactive learning experience.

We will learn how to interface and control various components in an optical setup, such as the laser, delay stage, optical rotation components, as well as the sampling and detection systems.

ARASH NEMATI</p> <p>In this hands-on session we will explore how to automate laboratory hardware using Python and the PyVISA library, featuring the Rigol DP832 programmable power supply as our primary example. We will walk through each step of connecting to and querying the device, configuring voltage/current setpoints, and performing controlled sweeps to characterize system behavior (e.g., voltage or current sweeps). By running live demonstrations of Python scripts, participants will observe how to capture real-time data\u2014such as measured voltages and currents\u2014and generate plots for analysis and reporting. We will also discuss important safety and equipment-protection measures, including setting appropriate voltage/current limits, managing output channels, and verifying signal integrity.

Open the terminal or command prompt and activate your environment if you close it for some reason. </p> <p>Firstly, we will install three of the most used python packages in academia <pre><code>pip install matplotlib numpy scipy\n</code></pre></p> <p>These are used to make plots, do scientific calculations, and statistical analysis (read more here numpy, scipy, and matplotlib).</p> <p>Next we need to help python to recognize and read for the usb ports of your computer. We need a library named libusb-1.0. While there are many ways to install this library, the easiest ways we found are the following.</p> <ul> <li>On windows, you need to go to libusb and mouseover Downloads and select the second option Latest Windows Binaries. Extract the file and choose the appropriate .dll. Example: Downloads\\libusb-1.0.29\\VS2022\\MS64\\dll\\libusb-1.0.dll. Copy this file and paste it in This PC\\Windows(C:)\\Windows\\System32</li> </ul> <p>-On several linux distributions, it is probably already installed. If not, just do </p> <pre><code>sudo apt install libusb-1.0\n</code></pre> <p>-On MacOs,</p> <pre><code>brew install libusb\n</code></pre> <p>Then install the python module pyusb <pre><code>pip install pyusb\npip install zeroconf psutil\n</code></pre> You can also install zeroconf and psutil. Without them, you might get some warnings when looking for devices. They are not necessary though.</p> <p>To test the pyusb installation open the python shell (by pressing python on the terminal or command prompt): and type:</p> <p><pre><code>import usb\n\nfor dev in usb.core.find(find_all=True):\n    print(dev)\n</code></pre> And press enter. The python shell should now be filled with a list of ports and information about them. Press exit() to leave the python shell.</p> <p>Now, we are ready to install PyVISA and  PySerial:</p> <pre><code>pip install PyVISA  PyVISA-py pyserial\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to use PyVISA you need to install National Instruments\u2019s VISA library or PyVISA-Py which is a pure Python implementation of the VISA standard. For this workshop PyVISA-Py is enough</p> <p>Finally, we want to install two modules to control a few Thorlabs devices, a linear stage and a powermeter:</p> <pre><code>pip install elliptec ThorlabsPM100\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>On windows, you also want to install the thorlabs software for the PM100D powermeter. In particular you want to install the Thorlabs driver switcher program, that comes also with the software for the power meter. You can look for  the driver switcher at the start up.</p> </li> <li> <p>On ubuntu and similar linux distros you might not have permissions to read the devices. Use sudo or change the permissions (see this example)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, we want you to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI), for that we will use PyQT5: <pre><code>pip install PyQT5\n</code></pre></p> <p>When you work with PyQT, it is a good idea to install PyQT Designer: </p> <ul> <li> <p>On windows: <pre><code>pip install PyQT5Designer\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>On ubuntu and similar linux distros, Designer comes with</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools\n</code></pre> <p>You can also install PyQT5 through apt:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5  \nsudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>On MacOS you need to download and install QT.
